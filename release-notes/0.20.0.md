- Introduces a notation (that we call 'extended json') for supporting writing
some extra firestore types: int (all numbers where transformed to floating point
before), geopoints and binary. Dates are now supported via this new notation, t
he old 'timestamps' flag is therefore removed. 
    
- Commands that display firestore documents (get, getall, query) now accept a
new flag to print documents using the new notation. By default, the default unma
rshalling is used (which loses type information).
    
- All commands that display firestore documents now display the full informati
on of the document snapshot (as it was the case only for the query command befor
e) instead of only the data.

- Documents are now displayed with the full path.
